Ever since I was young, I have been fascinated by the way technology shapes the world around us. From coding small games in middle school to building a website for my local community, I have always sought to explore how software can solve real-life problems. 

My passion for computer science grew in high school, where I led a team project that developed a scheduling app for students struggling with time management. This experience taught me not only the value of technical skills, but also the importance of teamwork, persistence, and user-focused design.

What excites me about your university is its strong emphasis on innovation and interdisciplinary learning. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to work with faculty who are leading research in AI and machine learning, as well as the hands-on labs that allow students to turn ideas into real-world applications.

Through this program, I hope to sharpen my programming skills, gain deeper insight into ethical AI, and contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact. Ultimately, my goal is to build technology that is both intelligent and inclusive.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to join a vibrant academic community where I can grow as a student, a thinker, and a creator.
